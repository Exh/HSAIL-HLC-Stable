Known Issues:
The LLVMTargetMachine now complains if it see and ignores a FeatureString value.
   cal= and -mwgs are in this category. Need a solution.
The GPU sub-type has to be passed in CPU, not FS.
Doesn't pass 100% conformance, but passes most tests with an appropriate library binary.
   Mostly image related things failing... possibly library issues.
   On the Mac, I'm using a library binary generated with Apple's LLVM 3212 tools.

The files here don't form a complete buildable set on either the Mac or PC.
The previous rev of these files (8.91-based) were buildable on PC. But I then took those
and integrated a bunch of Apple-specific files (especially the Makefile), removing PC-specific
files to produce the buildable-on-Mac LLVM 3318-based backend. Aside from the diffs in the
files that ARE a part of this checkin, the following files were in the PC-only or the Mac-only.
Generally, I tried to leave things in the PC-only 'configuration', but some of the files
that changed probably depend on Mac-only files (I change GPU names, for example).

Here is a list of files that are in one platform, but not the other:

Only in Mac: Apple - Apple only TD files. Already added in to PC tree.
Only in Mac: macrodata.cpp
Only in Mac: macrodata.h
Only in Mac: macrodb.h
Only in Mac: macrodb_gen.h
Only in Mac: prellvm2376 - Pre-llvm 2376 TD files.

Only in PC: AMDILFormatsApple.td - Removed, not used.
Only in PC: AMDILInstrConversion.macros
Only in PC: AMDILInstrIntrinsicsApple.td - Removed, not used.
Only in PC: AMDILIntrinsicsApple.td - Removed, not used.
Only in PC: AMDILNodesApple.td - Removed, not used.
Only in PC: AddrSpaces.txt
Only in PC: AsmParser
Only in PC: CMakeLists.txt
Only in PC: Disassembler
Only in PC: Doxyfile
Only in PC: External
Only in PC: Internal/AMDILCIDevice.cpp
Only in PC: Internal/AMDILCIDevice.h
Only in PC: Internal/AMDILTNDevice.cpp
Only in PC: Internal/AMDILTNDevice.h
Only in PC: LICENSE.TXT
Only in PC: MDParser
Only in PC: TD-Class-Flow-new.xmi
Only in PC: TD-Class-Flow.xmi
Only in PC: TargetInfo/CMakeLists.txt
Only in PC: build
Only in PC: generateRegisters.pl

The only files that are on both platforms that changed from 8.91/PC to 3318/Mac but aren't
copied here are the Makefile (huge diffs from PC to Mac, regardless of version) and
Processors.td, which I modified for the Mac to use the real SI names and delete the names of
processors beyond SI. So you have the 8.91/PC Processors.td, which is incompatible with the
source files that are expecting the real SI names.
