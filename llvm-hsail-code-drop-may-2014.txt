LLVM-HSAIL compiler source drop (05/15/2014):

This drop gives "Top-of-Trunk" OpenCL LLVM-HSAIL code generator for use by
the HSA Foundation members. Please note the following:

1. This code generator is being heavily used by OpenCL compiler and not tested for
any other languages. Due to this, the meta-data required by the backend, host or
runtime may not be generated by this compiler
2. This drop need the libHSAIL to be built before building this compiler. Since,
libHSAIL (in github) is compatible with this HSAIL code generator, this drop has
the "Top-of-Trunk" libHSAIL. Once the new (provisional 1.0) spec libHSAIL is given
in the github, that should be used instead of the one given in this drop.
3. The steps to build is as follows:
	a) Build libHSAIL (use instructions from libHSAIL on github)
	b) Build LLVM from llvm/build directory by giving "make"
4. For testing the compiler, the directory "tests" has about 25 test cases (OpenCL 
files). There is a shell script which runs all the tests and generates the HSAIL.
5. The binary ("bin") directory has the built "CLC" (OpenCL front-end), OpenCL
builtin library (in LLVM bc format), HSAILAsm (HSAIL assembler/disassembler) for
convenience.
